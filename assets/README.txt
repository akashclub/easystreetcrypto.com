EASY STREET — INTRO SITE PACKAGE
================================

FILES TO REPLACE (drop your real assets):
- /assets/intro.mp4    <-- Your 451MB VideoHive globe animation
- /assets/track.mp3    <-- Your 45s re-record (convert your .mov to mp3 first)
- /assets/logo.png     <-- Your logo (transparent PNG or SVG saved as PNG)

HOW TO DEPLOY ON GODADDY (File Manager):
1) Download this folder as ZIP, unzip locally.
2) Upload all files to your hosting root (often 'public_html').
3) Ensure the intro video is at /assets/intro.mp4 and audio at /assets/track.mp3.
4) Visit https://yourdomain.com  (index.html loads the cinematic intro).

PASSWORD-PROTECTED PRIVATE AREA:
- Place any private content in /private
- In GoDaddy, use "Directory Privacy" to password‑protect /private.
  (This generates a proper .htaccess and .htpasswd for you.)

NOTES:
- Browsers block autoplay with sound. Visitors click "Enable Sound" once, then "Enter".
- You can change the "Enter Site" destination in assets/script.js if needed.
