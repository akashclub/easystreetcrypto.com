# ----- SAMPLE PASSWORD PROTECTION (Apache/GoDaddy) -----
# 1) In GoDaddy/cPanel, use "Directory Privacy" (Password Protect Directories)
# 2) Protect the /private folder and create users there — it will generate a real .htaccess and .htpasswd for you.
# 3) This sample is here only for reference.

# AuthType Basic
# AuthName "Private Client — Easy Street Financial"
# AuthUserFile "/home/youraccount/.htpasswd"   # <- path auto-generated by GoDaddy
# Require valid-user
